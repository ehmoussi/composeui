# Roadmap

What's left to do on ComposeUI. It merges the earlier plans and the library review
(`NEXT_PLAN.md`, `PAGES_PLAN.md`, `WEB_BACKEND_PLAN.md`, `REVIEW.md`); everything they
listed as done is gone from here, and lives in the code, the README and `git log`. Build
and test each step before moving on, and delete a step's entry once it lands.

## 1 — Widgets

One widget at a time, each on Qt, Textual and the web with tests (the registry consistency
test requires all three backends to register the same keys). Already there: input, float
input, label, log, checkbox, radio group, combobox, read-only table, forms, pages.

1. **Tabs** (`TabView`). Distinct from pages: tabs live inside a page or form, and aren't
   routes.
2. **Simple dialogs** (`DialogView`): message and confirm, beyond the open/save file
   dialogs. On the web, a `<dialog>` the server opens through an OOB swap.
3. **Progress bar** (`ProgressBarView`).
4. **Tree view** (`TreeView`), and editable table cells if an app needs them.

The web versions follow the same rules as the existing ones: the element that sent the
request is never swapped back (the focus rule), changes elsewhere arrive as OOB updates,
`aria-*` links between a field, its label and its log, and a `make css` rebuild when new
classes appear (a test fails otherwise).

## 2 — Adoption

1. **API reference docs** (mkdocs + mkdocstrings; the code is fully typed), with a widget
   catalog and a short architecture page (views, signals, renderers, the registry).
2. **Packaging story** for apps built on ComposeUI: PyInstaller or briefcase for Qt, a
   plain `uvicorn` deployment note for the web.
3. **`CHANGELOG.md`, semantic versions and a PyPI release.**

## 3 — Later, when needed

- **Web: keep sessions across restarts.** Persist each session's `save_state` JSON (a
  directory, or Redis) and reload it when a cookie for an unknown session arrives; needs a
  fixed signing key from the environment. Only worth it for a deployed app, which also
  raises multi-process serving (sessions live in one process's memory today).
- **A generic `ToolBar` view.** Toolbar entries are per page today (`PageView.action`);
  a toolbar of arbitrary actions can come when an app wants one.

## Design notes for the web backend

Not tasks: the non-obvious decisions to keep in mind when changing `composeui.webcore`.
The README's "Web backend" section covers what users see.

- **htmx request/response**, no websockets or JS framework; Starlette, not FastAPI;
  hand-written HTML per renderer (no Jinja2), all view text through `html.escape`.
- **Ids.** A renderer's rendered object is `cui-{id(view)}-{role}`; a hidden fragment's
  root keeps its id (`hidden` attribute) so a later swap has a target.
- **Updates.** Setting a view attribute marks its renderer dirty in a request-scoped set
  (`collect_dirty`, a no-op outside requests); the route then renders every dirty
  fragment as an OOB swap (`render_dirty`). Controls use `hx-swap="none"` and the sender
  is never swapped back, so typing is never interrupted; the one exception is a float
  field left with unparsable text, swapped back to the view's value.
- **Sessions.** A signed cookie maps to a `WebSession` holding its renderers by id and an
  `RLock` (the status bar timer takes it through `call_on_main_thread`). A request whose
  session is gone answers `HX-Refresh`.
- **Open** applies an upload to a scratch instance first (core's `load_state_data`), so a
  bad file never half-loads. Responses send `Cache-Control: no-store` and controls set
  `autocomplete="off"`, so a reload always shows the server's state.
- **By design:** `Menu.is_visible` is ignored (a dropdown is always shown); action `data`
  isn't displayed; Ctrl shortcuts become Alt+Shift; an unknown page address is a 404, not
  a redirect (browsers ask for addresses of their own, like `/favicon.ico`).
- **Tests** drive the examples over HTTP with Starlette's `TestClient`
  (`tests/test_webrenderer.py`); browser-only behaviour (caret, shortcuts, `aria-invalid`
  sync, offline page, history) is in `tests/test_browser.py` (`make browser-test`).
